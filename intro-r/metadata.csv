"The University of Florida’s Saint Domingue Collection; the Manuscripts: 16 online volumes corresponding to the 16 reels of microfilm from the University Library’s collection from which manuscripts were extracted and digitized. (The Saint Domingue Collection, an assemblage of 20 reels of microfilm containing 186 print titles and several hundred manuscripts and maps illustrative of the colonial era in the French Colony of Saint-Domingue, was assembled by University of Florida librarians in the mid-1950s. Most of the documents came from the French National Archives, although a portion of the manuscripts were mined from the University’s own collections. The University Library generously loaned the film to LLMC for digitization to enrich its Haiti Legal Patrimony Collection, and also bore half the cost of the digitization. Unfortunately, all of these historical gems have long languished in obscurity in their film format, and would have met much the same fate had that same formatting been transferred directly online. Therefore, while the provenance of each separate item is carefully acknowledged, the collection has been broken up into smaller units to make them more discoverable and citeable as follows. All of the print items were reassembled in the following pattern: A.) 69 print items are offered on this site as standalone titles; B.) 67 print items were reassembled into a composite title covering Activities in Saint Domingue; C.) 27 print items were reassembled into a a composite title - French Documents Related to Saint-Domingue; D.) 19 print items were reassembled into a a composite title - French Documents Related to the French Colonies; and E.) all of the hundreds of manuscripts were organized into a composite title of 16 volumes entitled Saint Domingue Collection, The Manuscripts. While the manuscript volumes follow a somewhat different plan, all of the parts within each of the three composite print titles {B-C-D above} are organized in rough chronological order, and each composite title has been enhanced with a detailed Table of Contents. Given that the part numbers assigned to these items will never change, a given part can be cited with confidence. The manuscripts that were extracted from those 16 reels of the microfilm that contained manuscripts have been grouped into the 16 online volumes comprising the present composite title, with the items appearing in the exact order in which they appeared on the film, along with images of any film guides that may have been provided. Each of the 16 online volumes is also being provided with its own “living index.” LLMC welcomes additions to these “living indexes” as volunteered by interested scholars willing to submit their identifications of particular manuscripts or notes of related historical content. Updated versions of the indexes will be “swapped in” as additional editorial matter is received.

While the manuscript volumes follow a somewhat different plan, all of the parts within each of the three composite print titles {B-C-D above} are organized in rough chronological order, and each composite title has been enhanced with a detailed Table of Contents.
